# TaktX

TaktX is a local, privacy-focused video archiver and clipper. It allows you to download, trim, tag, and organize YouTube videos into a private offline library without relying on external cloud services.

## Features

* **Offline Archiving:** Download full videos or specific time ranges.
* **Organization:** Manage clips with Profiles, Groups, and Tags.
* **Bulk Editing:** Edit tags and groups for multiple videos at once.
* **Privacy:** Runs entirely on `localhost`. Stores downloaded video clips and etadata locally.

## Requirements

1. **Python 3.10+** installed.
2. [**FFmpeg**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-full.7z) and [**yt-dlp**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp.exe) binaries must be downloaded manually and placed next to this.

## Usage
